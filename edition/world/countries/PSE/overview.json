Needs, particularly water and electricity, are particularly acute in Gaza, where 22,600 Palestinians remain displaced following the conflict in 2014. The blockade continues to severely restrict access and the movement of people and goods.</p>\n\n<p>INFORM measures Palestine's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster for 2018 to be at 4.6/10, down from 6.1/10 in 2016.
