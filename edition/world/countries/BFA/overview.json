The armed groups are instrumentalizing pre-existing tensions between farmers and herders. Increased violence in 2019 led to the displacement of more than 239,000 people since January, bringing the total of internally displaced to around 289,000.? On 11 January, the State of Emergency declared on 31 December was extended for six months in 14 provinces mainly located in the Boucle du Mouhoun, Nord, Sahel, and Est regions. ? The status still holds true as of September 2019.</p>\n\n<p>A total of 1.5 million people are in need of assistance in Burkina Faso, including around 949,000 in conflict-affected areas in the northern regions. IDPs and host communities have urgent multiple sectoral needs. Continuous conflict drive food insecurity, as displaced people cannot access their fields and/or markets. Health needs are high as access to services is poor and insecurity has led to the suspension of services in several health centers. More than 2,024 schools remain closed; leaving more than 330,000 children without access to education in six regions. Access to water remains a major issue, particularly in the Sahel region. ?</p>\n\n<p>INFORM measures Burkina Fasoâ€™s risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be medium, at 5.1/10. A lack of coping capacity and vulnerability are all at concerning levels, at 6.1/10 and 5.8/10 respectively.</p>"}
