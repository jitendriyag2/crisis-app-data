Decades of conflict have had a severe impact on infrastructure, resilience, and population movement; in the first four months of 2019, more than 80,000 people were internally displaced by conflict. A severe drought in 2018 has triggered additional internal displacement, decreased livelihood opportunities, and driven food insecurity that impacts more than 35% of the population, who largely rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. 11.3 million people are currently estimated to face Crisis and Emergency (IPC 3 and 4) levels of food insecurity. An increasing number of returnee-IDPs, primarily from Iran, put additional pressure on host community resources and international assistance.</p>"}
