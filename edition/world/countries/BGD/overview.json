Since the latest violent episode of August 2017, some 741,577 Rohingya refugees have crossed the border from Rakhine state. As of 15 May 2019, there were 910,619 refugees living in 35 sites in Ukhiya and Teknaf sub-districts of Cox’s Bazar.?</p>\n\n<p>Bangladesh is not a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, and Rohingyas are registered as ‘Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals’. While the Government of Bangladesh has kept the borders open for refugees, there remain important gaps in assistance: refugees are officially not allowed to leave the camps, they are not permitted to work legally, and Rohingya youth are prevented from accessing quality education. According to the Acaps Basic Needs Gap Index, some 32% of the refugee population in 34 location of Cox’s Bazar have either high or very high gaps in meeting their basic humanitarian needs.</p>\n\n<p>The plan of the Government of Bangladesh to relocate some 100,000 Rohingyas from Cox’s Bazar to Bashan Char Island (also named Thengar Char) remains a cause for concern. Bangladeshi authorities have stated multiple times that relocation will be voluntary. However, the relocation plan has not gained traction with camp residents, as the island is particularly prone to flooding, and isolated from the mainland.</p>"}
